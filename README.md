## Initial project load

### Node.js
Before you begin, make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer, as you'll need npm (Node Package Manager) to manage the project's dependencies.

You can download and install Node.js from [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Gulp
You'll need **Gulp** to automate tasks in your project. You can install it globally on your system using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install --global gulp-cli
```

## Installation of Dependencies
Once you have Node.js and Gulp installed, you can proceed to install the specific dependencies for your project. Use the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo npm install gulp gulp-sourcemaps gulp-sass gulp-postcss autoprefixer cssnano sass gulp-avif gulp-webp gulp-imagemin gulp-purgecss @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss gulp-concat @fortawesome/fontawesome-free gulp-uglify gulp-strip-comments gulp-replace gulp-rename gulp-if gulp-append-prepend --save-dev
```

```bash
sudo npm install normalize.css @fortawesome/fontawesome-free --dev
```

Make sure to run this command in the root directory of your project.

These steps will allow you to set up your development environment properly and obtain all the necessary dependencies for your project.
